# React App

This repository is a react app that I made for a startup CodeNekt. It is a dynamic and complex app that uses react-router, react-redux, and react-bootstrap. It implements a sidebar navigation to switch between different pages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
